                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The feed.html file creates a structured feedback form for the "Feed The Future" website. It includes a header with a logo and a navigation bar linking to various pages, with the "Feedback" page marked as active for user indication. The feedback form is inside a .feedback-container div and consists of two sections: Personal Details and Feedback Details. The personal details section includes fields for name, email, phone number, and address, while the feedback section contains a text area, a rating system, and recommendation options. Additionally, a checkbox allows users to subscribe to email updates. The form provides Submit and Reset buttons for user interaction, and a footer displays copyright information and credits. The feed.css file styles the layout using Flexbox and applies background images. The navigation bar features a hover effect with a gradient transition, and the "Join" button includes a hover and scale effect. Form inputs are styled with borders, padding, and smooth transitions, while the Submit button is green and turns blue on hover, and the Reset button is red and turns light blue on hover. A blur effect is applied for a modern, glass-like UI, enhancing readability and user experience. The overall design ensures a clean, interactive, and responsive interface</p>

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The HTML and CSS files create a well-structured and visually appealing "Our Team" webpage for the "Zero Hunger" initiative. The HTML (team.html) lays out the content, including a navigation bar, a video background, and a grid-style section showcasing team members with their names, roles, and contributions. The CSS (team_style.css) styles the page with a cohesive color palette, responsive design, and interactive elements like hover effects on navigation links and team member cards. Together, they provide an engaging, user-friendly interface with modern web design features. Let me know if you’d like me to tweak or add anything!</p>
